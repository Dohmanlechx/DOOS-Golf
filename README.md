# Mini-Golf game
Those mini-golf games out here are always containing silly, too-much-gimmicked and luck-based courses. How can you show your real mini-golf skills then? There you got our concept of this project! To begin with, we will make 5 dead serious and 5 platform based courses. Hopefully, we will expand it a lot more later!

## Game mechanics - standard mini-golf
Firstly, you have got to choose where to place your ball in the very beginning of the course, just like IRL. You will be able to draw a line behind the ball, and then release to shoot the ball in the opposite direction. Also, the longer line you draw, the harder the shooting will be. The ball will act as authenical as possible, and the holes will have positive Z-value so the ball falls into accordingly to the physics engine just if the current speed isn't too high. There will, of course, also be a nice scoreboard where your scores will be stored.

The game will support multiplayer offline, up to 4-6 players.
