# Mini-Golf game
Those mini-golf games out here are always containing silly, too-much-gimmicked and luck-based courses. How can you show your real mini-golf skills then? There you got our concept of this project! To begin with, we will make 5 dead serious and 5 platform based courses. Hopefully, we will expand it a lot more later!

## Game mechanics - standard mini-golf
You will be able to draw a line behind the ball, and then release to shoot the ball in the opposite direction. Also, the longer line you draw, the harder the shooting will be. The ball will act as authenical as possible, and the holes will have small collider circles so you don't score just because the ball touches the edge of the hole. There will, of course, be a nice scoreboard where your scores will be stored.

The game will support multiplayer offline, up to 4-6 players.
